# sandbox hackathon project

## Prompt: On campus parking ðŸš— is a pain. Launch a startup that solves this problem.

## Idea: 
### Here are a couple of ideas that will not actually solve the problem. 
#### 1) Any type of parking monitoring.
It really is not hard to guess whether or not a lot will be full. I know that if I try to park by the smith field house Monday morning after 9 AM, there is not going to be parking. Further, I can just drive to a different lot.
#### 2) Anything to increase supply.
Too long a process, BYU clearly is not interested. Other lots restricting students from parking need their lots for something else.

### What can help?
#### Public transportation
Provo spent millions of dollars tearing apart Provo roads to install a bus line - for no charge to passengers. Students can travel for free to either end of campus for free, but the bus is almost always empty. How can we encourage students to take the bus more often?

## Bussn - Verification system for riders to log each of their rides on public transportation and a marketplace for redeeming points and carbon offsets
### Why?
We want to incentivize public transportation. One more bus passenger is one less car parked. Further, because companies have monetary and cultural pressure to pursue ESG, we can provide a platform where they can reward environmentally-savvy individuals.

### How?
First we need a way to verify who is actually taking the bus.


Bussn uses a 3-layer verification system

1) QR code for a uniqe bus ID
2) Computer vision verification
3) Location tracking

Assuming the rider meets all the checks, their ride is registered in the system. Riders are also prompted to take a selfie on each ride, creating a Be-Real-type feed where of themselves and their friends taking public transportation.
